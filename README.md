# Setup

First install pnpm. Once you're done installing pnpm go to the root of this project and run `pnpm install`

After you've installed the files run:
```
pnpm dev
```
 
and it should run the app on `localhost:3000`. Open up your browser and go there to see the app running.

# Packages

I've installd `svelteui` as our component library.
