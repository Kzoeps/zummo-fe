# Setup

So I've used pnpm as the package manager for this, if you have it please move on to the next step. If you dont first install pnpm. Heres the (https://pnpm.io/installation)[link].

For Mac its as easy as
```
brew install pnpm
```

If you have node installed tho you can do this

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

## after pnpm installation

After you've installed pnpm, run this in the root of this project:

```
pnpm install
```

And then once you've installed it run this command to start the app:

```
pnpm run dev
```
